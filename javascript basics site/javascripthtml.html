				<h1>JavaScript Basics</h1>
				<p>
					JavaScript is a cross-platform, object=oriented scripting language. Javascript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexability for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lines insclasse a host enviroment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these enviroments to provclasse programmatic control over them.

				<ul>
					<li><a href="var_declearation">Variable Declearation</a> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be indentified with unique names. These unique names are called classentifiers.<span class="purple">var x;</span></li>
					<li><a href="var_assignment">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span class="purple">var x = 10;</span></li>
					<li><a href="data_types">Data Types</a> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <span class="purple">true</span> and <span class="purple">false;</span> null - <span class="purple">null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span class="purple">42</span> or <span class="purple">3.14159;</span> String - <span class="purple">"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Array - <span class="purple"> [1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo'];</span>and Object -<span class="purple">{first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</span></li>
					<li><a href="conditionals">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting diferent code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: <span class="purple">if</span>a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span class="purple">else if</span>to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span class="purple">else</span>we execute this block of code;</li>
					<li><a href="loops">Loops</a> There are many diferent kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run arround the track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop!</li>
					<li><a href="function">Function</a> Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea. we open up the instruction manualand get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a tone more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.</li>
